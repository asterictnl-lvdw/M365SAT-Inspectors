Cyber adversaries have used POP as a workaround for subtly conducting password spraying attacks or other credential-related attacks, because POP is a form of legacy authentication generally not subject to the restraints of Multi-Factor Authentication and other modern authentication safeguards. For these reasons it is recommended that POP be disabled where possible."

A list of affected email addresses is included in this report. Key stakeholders should be polled prior to making this change, as there is a chance POP is used within the organization for legacy applications or service accounts."
