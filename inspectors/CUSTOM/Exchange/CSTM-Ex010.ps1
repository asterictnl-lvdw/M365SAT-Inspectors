Policy state definitions are: - Enable: The policy is enabled for actions and notifications. This is the default value. - Disable: The policy is disabled. - TestWithNotifications: No actions are taken, but notifications are sent. - TestWithoutNotifications: An audit mode where no actions are taken, and no notifications are sent."
