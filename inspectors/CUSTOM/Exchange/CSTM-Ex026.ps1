Cyber adversaries have used SMTP authentication as a workaround for subtly conducting password spraying attacks or other credential-related attacks, because SMTP authentication is a form of legacy authentication generally not subject to the restraints of Multi-Factor Authentication and other modern authentication safeguards. For these reasons it is recommended that SMTP Authentication be disabled where possible."
		Remediation	     = "This finding refers to individual mailboxes that have SMTP enabled. For these mailboxes, SMTP authentication can be disabled using the Set-CASMailbox commandlet. A list of affected email addresses is included in this report. Key stakeholders should be polled prior to making this change, as there is a chance SMTP is used within the organization for legacy applications or service accounts."
