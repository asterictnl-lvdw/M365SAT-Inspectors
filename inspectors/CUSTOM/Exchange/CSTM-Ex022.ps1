		Description	     = "Mailbox Auditing is an Exchange mailbox feature that, when activated, generates audit logs for events related to a user's use of email. This is one of the most oft-recommended security improvements to Exchange because mailbox audit logs can contain information critical in a detection or response scenario such as triaging a business email compromise. Mailbox auditing can be globally enabled at the tenant level, which supersedes all per-mailbox settings, but it is not currently enabled."
