If a suitably positioned adversary were to intercept or otherwise obtain the organization's email messages, they may be able to read this sensitive information as O365 emails are not cryptographically secured by default. O365 Message Encryption provides the ability to encrypt email sent through the organization's O365 instance and share encrypted email with any user that is emailed."
		Remediation	     = "Enabling Office Message Encryption can be a significant process that entails enabling the technology, determining which cryptographic key management strategy will be used, and enabling Exchange mail transport rules that will automatically encrypt the organization's email. For many organizations, this process can be simplified by using Microsoft's default cryptographic key management scheme; however, this is a decision that can only be made by someone with contextual knowledge of the organization's constraints. Please follow the detailed guide linked in the References section for more information."
